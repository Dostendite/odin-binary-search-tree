## Binary Search Tree for TOP

My first implementation of a tree data structure!

It comes equipped with many methods, such as
insert, remove, height, depth, balanced?, rebalance, etc...

There are two test files: *main.rb* is for my own tests,
and *assignment_test.rb* accomplishes the assignments
given in the BST project from the TOP curriculum.

## Possible improvements

- Optimize recursive methods
- Develop my method to print the tree
- Maybe get rid of private methods altogether
